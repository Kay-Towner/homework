#problem 1):

1.By running problem_1.py, the analytical derivative will be calculated
and put into the output file fname_part1.

2. The generated data from part 1 is turned to part two where the data is
plotted on a graph using matplotlib.

#problem 2):

1. Use problem one's outline as an example for this problem
2. Same as part 1., use the problem outline in the first problem, but use the
new position equation. 
3. Describe, using the work in problems 1 and 2 for looking at the analytical derivative
4.
